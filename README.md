# Quasar-1 Architecture
This is the title of your repository and briefly introduces Quasar-1 as an advanced LLM (large language model). It highlights the model's ability to process and generate text by focusing on critical (hot) and less relevant (cold) tokens, which aids in making responses more accurate and task-specific.

## Key Features
This section provides a detailed description of the primary mechanisms and innovations of Quasar-1. Let's break it down:

Token Temperature-Based Attention Modulation:

This refers to the method by which Quasar-1 prioritizes certain pieces of information over others. In natural language processing (NLP), certain words or tokens are more important for understanding context or solving a specific task. Token Temperature helps the model "cool down" its attention to less critical tokens while "heating up" focus on the most crucial ones.
This allows Quasar-1 to better handle complex queries and focus on the most relevant parts of an input, enhancing its decision-making process.
Prompt Refinement Loops:

In many NLP tasks, the quality of the response can be improved by refining the input. Quasar-1 uses Prompt Refinement Loops to iteratively adjust and optimize the input prompts, ensuring that the model's response is highly accurate and aligned with the userâ€™s expectations.
Think of it like an ongoing feedback loop, where the model continues to tweak and improve its understanding of the input during the process.
Task-Specific Performance:

This feature describes how Quasar-1 is optimized for specific tasks. Many language models are general-purpose, meaning they can answer a wide variety of questions but may not perform exceptionally well on particular tasks.
Quasar-1, however, is designed to specialize in certain tasks by refining how it processes data through the mechanisms described above.
